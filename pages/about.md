## About the Collection

When I first began preliminary research for this project, I could not find a publicly accessible digital repository for oral histories about pawpaws or persimmons. The interviewees highlighted in the collection unanimously agree that these fruits are still relatively underground. One of the reasons that pawpaws and persimmons are not well known is because of their short shelf-life. Pawpaws (asimina triloba) only have a harvesting period of about three weeks. Once ripe, they bruise easily and rot within a few days, which prevents them from being packaged and shipped outside of their region. They are elusive or unknown to many who are not connected to local farmerâ€™s markets and cultivators. American persimmons (diospyros virginiana) are only ripe when they drop to the ground, which the FDA has deemed unsafe, as they are contaminated with filth during their contact with the ground (Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, 2023). The Asian persimmon (diospyros kaki) can be picked while unripe and then ripen on the shelf, which makes some varieties of persimmons available to the public. American persimmons cannot be picked while unripe, and also spoil within a few days of ripening, as they are already in the process of rotting when ripe. So, how does one attempt to capture these two fruits for a digital archive?

This site originated as a digital oral history repository about pawpaws and persimmons. Folks from a myriad of backgrounds, who reside in Indiana and Kentucky (the native region of these fruits) have generously donated their stories about growing, using, and researching these two fruits. The repository has expanded to include images and objects of significance to the interviewees featured in the site. The objects highlighted in the collection were discussed in their oral histories, and are a visual representation of their relationship to pawpaws and persimmons, or they are representations of key components of their identity in general.
